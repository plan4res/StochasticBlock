# StochasticBlock

SMS++ `Block` that provides the "plumbing" for representing (possibly,
among other things) stochastic optimization models.

The `StochasticBlock` class is meant to represent a `Block` whose data
changes in a "scenario way", i.e., whole swathes of the data change all in
one blow. This is typical (among other things) in stochastic optimization
models, although `StochasticBlock` per se does not have any direct notion
of stochasticity. Indeed, a `StochasticBlock` is characterized by the
following:

- a single inner `Block` whose data changes; this can be any `:Block`

- some data of the inner `Block` is subject to changes, and the value
  for this data is represented by a vector of double; a an instance of
  this vector is called a *scenario* for the data (a common term in
  stochastic optimization), but note that this scenario information is
  not stored in the `StochasticBlock`

- `StochasticBlock` has a set of `DataMapping`. This is used to both
  identify the data in the inner `Block` that is subject to change and
  to modify the values of this data. The inner `Block` may have different
  pieces of changing data, located in different sub-`Block` of its; a
  single `DataMapping` is meant to represent one of these pieces data.

- `StochasticBlock` has a `set_data()` method which takes has a scenario
  (a vector) as parameter and sets the data of the inner `Block` according
  to its set of `DataMapping`


## Getting started

These instructions will let you build StochasticBlock on your system.

### Requirements

- [SMS++ core library](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp)

### Build and install with CMake

Configure and build the library with:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The library has the same configuration options of
[SMS++](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project/-/wikis/Customize-the-configuration).

Optionally, install the library in the system with:

```sh
sudo make install
```

### Usage with CMake

After the library is built, you can use it in your CMake project with:

```cmake
find_package(StochasticBlock)
target_link_libraries(<my_target> SMS++::StochasticBlock)
```

### Running the tests with CMake

Some unit tests will be built with the library.
Launch `ctest` from the build directory to run them.
To disable them, set the option `BUILD_TESTING` to `OFF`.

### Build and install with makefiles

Carefully hand-crafted makefiles have also been developed for those unwilling
to use CMake. Makefiles build the executable in-source (in the same directory
tree where the code is) as opposed to out-of-source (in the copy of the
directory tree constructed in the build/ folder) and therefore it is more
convenient when having to recompile often, such as when developing/debugging
a new module, as opposed to the compile-and-forget usage envisioned by CMake.

Each executable using `StochasticBlock` has to include a "main makefile" of
the module, which typically is either [makefile-c](makefile-c) including all
necessary libraries comprised the "core SMS++" one, or
[makefile-s](makefile-s) including all necessary libraries but not the "core
SMS++" one (for the common case in which this is used together with other
modules that already include them). One relevant case is the [unit
tests](test/test.cpp). The makefiles in turn recursively include all the
required other makefiles, hence one should only need to edit the "main
makefile" for compilation type (C++ compiler and its options) and it all
should be good to go. In case some of the external libraries are not at
their default location, it should only be necessary to create the
`../extlib/makefile-paths` out of the `extlib/makefile-default-paths-*` for
your OS `*` and edit the relevant bits (commenting out all the rest).
